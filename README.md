Not Found Cacher
================

A simple cacher module for ProcessWire that's caches the contents for the 404 page (since ProCache doesn't support that).

Installation
------------

Install the module via Composer:

```
composer require avoineoy/notfoundcacher
```

When installing via Composer, it is recommended that you also add the module directory (usually /site/modules/NotFoundCacher) to .gitignore file.
